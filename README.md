# Financial Risk Analysis Dashboard - Lending Club

This repository contains the data preparation phase for an interactive financial risk analysis dashboard built with Tableau. The project involves cleaning and transforming a large dataset from Lending Club to create a focused and efficient data source for visualization.

## üìã Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze loan data to identify key drivers of loan defaults. The dashboard provides insights into:
*   Overall portfolio performance and default rates.
*   Risk profiles based on loan grades and purposes.
*   Geographical distribution of risk across a map.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preparation

The data preparation is done in the Jupyter Notebook located in the `notebooks/` folder. The process includes:

1.  **Optimized Loading:** Reading a multi-gigabyte CSV file efficiently by selecting only relevant columns.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing text fields (e.g., `emp_length`).
3.  **Feature Engineering:** Creating a key `loan_condition` column ('Good' vs. 'Bad') to simplify risk analysis.
4.  **Final Output:** Exporting a clean, analysis-ready CSV file to be used as the data source in Tableau.

### Data Source
The data used is the **[Lending Club Loan Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club )** from Kaggle.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Replicate

This project uses the Kaggle API to download the necessary data.

1.  **Set up your environment:**
    *   Clone this repository.
    *   Create a virtual environment and install the required packages (e.g., `pip install pandas numpy kaggle`).
    *   Ensure your Kaggle API credentials (`kaggle.json`) are set up correctly on your machine.

2.  **Run the data preparation notebook:**
    *   Open and run the `notebooks/01-lendingclub-data-prep.ipynb` notebook.
    *   The notebook will automatically download the required compressed data file (`accepted_2007_to_2018Q4.csv.gz`) from Kaggle using the API.

3.  **Find the output:**
    *   After the notebook runs successfully, it will generate the final, clean dataset at `data/cleaned_loan_data.csv`..
